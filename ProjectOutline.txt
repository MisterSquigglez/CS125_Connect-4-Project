To Do
=======================================
-Switch between red/yellow during turns
    Indicate whose turn it is
    Use an array
    For turns: Use for loop
        Total turns: 42
    
-Check for invalid input or if a column is full
    Invalid inputs: Use while loop

-Make sure the program reads the right color and makes sure they are in a row
    Assign a value or 1 or 2 depending on color of chip
    Add animation?
    Make sure chip goes to the bottom of each column

-Check all possible win conditions

-Use array for storing input
    Use a for loop with x and y to check win conditions

-Check every turn for a win and also check if a tie has occcured

-Annouce the winner at the end or tie/draw


Information to Know
=======================================
-Possible Win Conditions
    Vertical Wins:      7x3     21
    Horizonal Wins:     6x4     24
    Forward Slash Wins: 3x4     12
    Backward Slash wins 3x4     12

-Total Win Combinations: 69


Example of reading win conditions (Horizontal):


for (color = 1; color < 3; color++){
for (xshift = 0; xshift < 4; xshift++){
    for (x = 0 + xshift; x < 4 + xshift; x++){
        for (y = 0; y < 6; y++){
            if (array[x][y] == color array [x][y] == color array[x][y] == color array [x][y] == color){
            Code
       }
    }
}
