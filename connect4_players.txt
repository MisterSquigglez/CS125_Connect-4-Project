This part of the code will switch back and forth between the players

-we need to specify the columns on the board

-this program needs to keep in mind if colunms are full or not

int location();

int main()
{
int player1=1; //red \e[1;31m
int player2=2; //blue \e[1;34m

     while (board != full) //this bit will keep running until board is full
        {
            int location;

            prinf("Player 1 type your column number(1-7)/n");
            scanf("%d", &location);
            chipPosition();    
           
            prinf("Player 2 type your column number(1-7)/n");
            scanf("%d", &location);
            chipPosition();

        
        }
    return location;
}
         
      
int location(int loc)
{
    int place;
        if (place==1) //places chip in the FIRST colunm 
            { 
            //needs to read the board and choose
            printf("O");
            }
        else if (location==2) //places chip in the SECOND colunm 
            { 
            //needs to read the board and choose
            printf("O");
            } 
        else if (location==3) //places chip in the THIRD colunm 
            { 
            //needs to read the board and choose

            }

            {
